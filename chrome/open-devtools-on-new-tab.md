# Open Devtools automatically on new tabs

this is very useful if you want to see the network request for a new tab that is created when clicking a link with `target=_blank` 

to achive this close all chrome instances and start Chrome from a terminal with the following commandline flag 
```sh
googlechrome --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
```

for MacOS that looks like
```sh
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --auto-open-devtools-for-tabs
```
